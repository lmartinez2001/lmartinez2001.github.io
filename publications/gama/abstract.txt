Agent-based models (ABMs) and video games, including those taking advantage of virtual reality (VR), have 
undergone a remarkable parallel evolution, achieving impressive levels of complexity and sophistication. This 
paper argues that while ABMs prioritize scientific analysis and understanding and VR aims for immersive 
entertainment, they both simulate artificial worlds and can benefit from closer integration. Coupling both 
approaches  indeed  opens  interesting  possibilities  for  research  and  development  in  various  fields,  and  in 
particular education, at the heart of the SIMPLE project, an EU-funded project on the development of digital 
tools  for  awareness  raising  on  environmental  issues.  However,  existing  tools  often  present  limitations, 
including  technical  complexity,  limited  functionalities,  and  lack  of  interoperability.  To  address  these 
challenges, we introduce a novel framework for linking GAMA, a popular ABM platform, with Unity, a 
widely used game engine. This framework enables seamless data exchange, real-time visualization, and user 
interaction within VR environments, allowing researchers to leverage the strengths of both ABMs and VR for 
more impactful and engaging simulations. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework through two 
prototypes built to highlight its potential in representing and interacting with complex socio-environmental 
system models. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of continued collaboration between the ABM 
and VR communities to develop robust, user-friendly tools, paving the way for a new era of collaborative 
research and immersive experiences in simulations.
